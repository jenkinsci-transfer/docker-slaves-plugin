 * A slave that is designed to be used only once, for a specific ${@link hudson.model.Run}, and as such has a life cycle
 * to fully match the Run's one.
 * <p>
 * Provisioning such a slave should be a lightweight process, so one can provision them at any time and concurrently
 * to match ${@link hudson.model.Queue} load. Typical usage is Docker container based Jenkins agents.
 * <p>
 * Actual launch of the Slave is postponed until a ${@link Run} is created, so we can have a 1:1 match between Run and
 * Executor lifecycle:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>dump the launch log in build log.</li>
 *     <li>mark the build as ${@link Result#NOT_BUILT} on launch failure.</li>
 *     <li>shut down and remove the Executor on build completion</li>
